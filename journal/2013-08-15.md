### Reformatted Google Sheet

I've unified all the data on one worksheet called `Data`. The first two (frozen) columns have the year and total number of paintings - these remain constant no matter what the query is. Every query has three columns after that: absolute number of matching paintings, ratio, and 10-yr moving average of those ratios.

I am trying to make this even more efficient by just just importing the "ratio" column from the output of `trends.rb` and running the 10-year average calculation in Google Drive. 

Ideally, I could find an easy method to calculate a moving average in Ruby and just upload the final calculated column. However a quick survey online shows that this would take a bit of fiddling to implement, and for now it seems faster overall to just upload the year-by-year ratios and do the moving average in a spreadsheet program.

### Genre, ctd.

I am further refining the "genre chart" that compares landscape to portraiture trends. I wanted to see if "portrait" keywords (`portrait` OR `portrait male` OR `portrait female` OR `portrait group`) intersected with "figure" keywords also used in the SAAM schema (`figure` OR `figure male` OR `figure female` OR `figure group`).
