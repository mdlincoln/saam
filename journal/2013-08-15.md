### Reformatted Google Sheet

I've unified all the data on one worksheet called `Data`. The first two (frozen) columns have the year and total number of paintings - these remain constant no matter what the query is. Every query has three columns after that: absolute number of matching paintings, ratio, and 10-yr moving average of those ratios.

### Genre, ctd.

I am further refining the "genre chart" that compares landscape to portraiture trends. I wanted to see if "portrait" keywords (`portrait` OR `portrait male` OR `portrait female` OR `portrait group`) intersected with "figure" keywords also used in the SAAM schema (`figure` OR `figure male` OR `figure female` OR `figure group`).
