## Code

I've set up `trends.rb` so that you will enter a custom query each time into the script. Trying to anticipate queries from stdin is not worth the time.

The `TARGET` variable will now just be made the filename of the CSV output. I've also set up the query like so:

````ruby
with_topic = data.select{|k,v| 
	v["Date"]==step && 
	(
		v["Topic"].include?("western")
		# AND/OR [another query here]
	)
}.count.to_f
````

## Visualizations

Discovered something interesting with the following queries:

- `landscape`
- `portraiture`
- `western`
- `landscape && western`

There is a huge drop-off after 1850 in the ratio of portraiture, with an almost equal rise in landscape paintings. What else is interesting is that right in this same period is the only visible lump of "western" paintings, peaking right before the big changes begin.

**Is there something about western genre paintings that irrevocably shifted the preferred genre of American artists?**
