### Trends in the full SAAM dataset

I want to repeat some of the charts I made using just the paintings subset of the SAAM collections data.

#### Genres

- `landscape`

- `portraiture` (made from a query of: `(portrait OR portrait male OR portrait female OR portrait group)`)

- `western`

- `abstract`

The same general trend still appears, although the huge dropoff in portraiture paintings is less pervasive when other formats are added in.

It is interesting to see the difference in the trendline for abstract artworks. Paintings have a spike in the late 1960s and then fall off precipitously. However factoring in other artworks, abstraction dips down **but remains at the 25% level from the 1980s onward**.

I also tried adding in `cityscape`, which shows a modest accumulation up through the 1850s, peaking in the 1980s (although with a **distinct dip in the late 1960s coincident with the spike in abstract artworks**)

#### Ethnicities

- `ethnic`

- `indian`

- `african-american`

This shows largely the same trends as the paintings alone.

#### Gender

- `figure male` OR `portrait male`

- `figure female` OR `portrait female`

A preponderance of male figures drops down to rough equilibrium with female figures between 1850-1900, and remains like that for the rest of the time span.
